# Agile Adoption using TeamPulse

TeamPulse is Telerik's project management software.

* LEAN, SCRUM
* Product vision problems - communication issues.
	* Getting teams working together.
* Agile
	* Planning
	* Creation of user stories
	* Agile works at large scale
	* Agile isn't a silver bullet - it's how to improve the process.  It just shows problems.
* Most companies need 2.5 years to actually start doing SCRUM correctly.  Many quit after 1 year.
* Need managers to buy in.
* TFS integration
	* Work items synchronization.
	* Syncs with TFS data.
* This looks more intuitive than TFS to me.
* Separate web site for users / coworkers.  
* Customizable.

Questions
* How does this compare to competitors?  TFS, Teamwork.com, etc.  How to justify cost if already have TFS?
	* Has the concept of a release.
	* Tracks unplanned tasks
* Does this have a developer API?
