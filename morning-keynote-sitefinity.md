# Morning Keynote - Sitefinity

* Lots about Sitefinity
	* Real-time machine-driven personalization.  User sets up the content - then system adjusts content based on where the user visits (Google Ads).
		
Questions
* How is this better than Google Analytics or Piwik?  Is Telerik reinventing the wheel?
* Seems like a reasonable CMS - not sure how exactly it's different/better than alternatives.
