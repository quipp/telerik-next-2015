# Angular JS 2.0

	* Google engineers gave presentation - Victor Savkin
	* Great for large applications
	* Keys
	* 
		* Components - self-describing. 
		* 
			* Like classes - has a?
			* Properties & events => bindings
			* Lifecycle events (like web forms...)
			* Injectables?
			* host listeners/properties
			* Data is reflected into DOM - no direct DOM manipulation (client side MVC).
			* HTML version and object version.

		* Directives gone?
		* 
			* Component = most important directive.

		* Dependency injection
		* 
			* Component talks through interface - not direct class.
			* Injectibles, bind, toClass/Value.
			* Becomes more important the bigger things get.

		* Property bindings
		* 
			* Model -> components -> DOM
			* How does does AJS know about changes?
			* 
				* Zones.
				* Grouping of events + hierarchy.
				* No more scope.$apply
