# Building Offline Ready Mobile Apps

	* Presenter - Hristo Borisov
	* Telerik Platform offline capabilities
	* Need to think about off-line at the beginning.
	* Not just working without connection - can use offline techniques to improve experience via performance.
	* Offline
	* 
		* Offline storage
		* Sync
		* 
			* Client always wins
			* Server always wins
			* Customized

		* Conflict resolution
		* Caching

	* Best client storage is one which works seamlessly with server.
	* Telerik Backend Services is completely seamless - just flip the switch.
	* 
		* Still haven't finished full suite from Rollbase.
		* Automatic rest web service created for connector!
		* Can control local file system type (HTML 5MB or file system -> later SQLlite)
		* Does batch operation for SQL requests.

	* Kendo UI has build in offline but no conflict resolution (it's there, but not great)
	* JavaScript events for plugging in.
	* There is security system.

# Questions
