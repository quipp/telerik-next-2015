# What Kendo UI can and cannot do

* Presenter - Cody Lindley
* Slides - http://bit.ly/kendouimobilenext
* Kendo Mobile is subset of Kendo UI
* Kendo UI Mobile is free
* Includes single page application logic/tools - ut that is optional.
* Has a MVVM system.
	* How does this overlap with Angular JS?
* Platform agnostic (adjusts styling based on platform).  That is slick.
	* Can you customize each theme?
	* Can use one theme across all.
	* They have theme builder (just like jQuery Mobile UI).
* What is doesn't do
	* It is just JS widgets.
	* No native API access.
	* No development environment.
	* No testing tools.
	* Must combine with AppBuilder to get all that other features.
