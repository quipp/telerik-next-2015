# Angular JS and Kendo UI

	* Presenter - Jeremy Likness
	* Single page application framework (SPA).

		* Avoiding page refresh.

	* Expressions
	* Data-binding / MVVM
	* Container / dependency-injection
	* Templates (reusable sections)
	* Tools
	* Testable
	* Fast development - prototypes
	* Modules, Services, Controllers, Directives, Filters
	* Kendo UI built on jQuery.
	* Kendo UI Core is open source

		* What is the purpose of paying?

	* Angular JS has different data binding, routing, view/layout from Kendo UI.
	* Design code independent of AJS. Wire into AJS later.
	* Avoid scope - watchers are expensive.
	* 
		* Object.defineProperty to create property which calls the function.
		* AJS digest loop - walks through checking for changes. Figure out how this works... 


Questions

	* How does Kendo UI compare to other client side UI frameworks?
