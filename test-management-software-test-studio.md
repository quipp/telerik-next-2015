# Test Management Software - Test Studio

* Presenter - Jim Holmes
* Test Automation Tool - UI tool
* More communication / collaboration
	* Daily communication with testers.
	* Get conversations happening early - test in parallel.  A part of the dev process, not after.
	* Don't have a lot of duplicate testing.  Ok to do some at client side and some at code behind.
* Test Studio works with any HTML.
* Can even check the database.
* Good idea to add stuff to make more testable - add IDs.
