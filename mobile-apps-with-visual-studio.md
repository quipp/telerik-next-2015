* Presenter - Michael Crump
* How to touch all the devices?
* Mobile web
	* Universal / fastest.
	* Limited api
	* Not in app store.
* Hybrid (can use Telerik AppBuilder)
	* Mix.
	* Not as good performance.
	* Cordova requires plugins
	* Demo is using Cordova (HTML/JS).
	* It really is fast for the basics.
* Native
	* Power
	* API - Cordova is behind.
	* Expensive.
	* Universal Windows Apps?  Targets all of Windows stuff.
* Cross-Platform Native Apps
	* NativeScript.
	* Xamarin
		* Forms.
		* Looks like actual code differences.

Questions
* What is the difference between NativeScript and Cordova?  Is Cordova interpreted?
* How does it compare to alternatives (DevExpress)?
